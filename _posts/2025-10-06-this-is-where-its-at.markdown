Hi there! Welcome to Springer Mountain.

What is this place? That's a great question. Not sure yet, honestly. I can say a little about what I hope it'll be; beyond that, we'll have to see.

I intend this to be a place to talk about all the things I'm learning or want to learn, peppering in some of my other interests as I go.

At the core of it, I want this to be a chronicle as I begin learning how to make games. I'm a software engineer by trade, and I've periodically thought about getting into game development as a hobby, but I want to investigate it in earnest here, naive as that might sound. Keep an eye on this; I'll update soon with some of my first adventures.

Lastly, why Springer Mountain? Well, Springer Mountain in Georgia is the southern starting point of the [Appalachian Trail][appalachian-trail-wikipedia], the point at which most AT thru-hikers start their long journey northward. I've never hiked the AT, but I've heard stories of how difficult those first stretches can be, with many beginning in hopeful excitement only to slowly be daunted by the magnitude of what they've set out on. It's a tough journey by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a rewarding one for many.

Maybe I'm romanticizing things a bit, but at the outset I see this game development journey as a bit similar. A long road, one that could be equal parts beautiful, rewarding, fulfilling, demanding, and stressful. A road that, who knows, I may get partway down and realize how far in over my head I am. Regardless, it's a journey I want to take.
